## Project Introduction
Globally, close to 800,000 people die from suicide every year. That’s one person every 40 seconds. Due to the stigma associated with suicide – and the fact that it is illegal in some countries – this figure is also likely to be an underestimate, with some suicides being classified as unintentional injuries. This makes it one of the leading causes of death globally. But this could be changed. To prevent suicide, interventions need to take place from the universal to the individual level. Before we get into invervention directly, we need to understand what are the causes of suicide. At the individual level, the causes could be depression, mental illness, the feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. What if bring it to a higher level? Could a country’s economic development, or the overall happiness in society be a factor of suicide as well? 


## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to contribute to a high-level political direction for the government to prevent suicide. 
 
## Datasets Used
1. **[Suicide Rates Overview Data](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016/data#)**

  This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum.

2. **[World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2015.csv)**

  The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
